Service Blueprint Mini is a small local-first planning tool for solo builders, operators, and creative teams who want a cleaner way to manage stages. Add items, score the signal, track the friction, and keep the strongest opportunities visible without needing a backend or build step.

## Features

- Local-first persistence with `localStorage`
- Search and filter controls
- Ranked list sorted by signal minus friction
- Inline editor for title, notes, type, status, score, and effort
- Import/export JSON backups
- Re-seed action for resetting the sample board
- Keyboard shortcuts: `N` for new, `/` for search
- No build tooling, just open in a browser

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/service-blueprint-mini.git
cd service-blueprint-mini
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000>.
